int * pointer_to_a = &a
* means you are declaring a pointer. 
It also means you are to search for the value where the pointer leads instead of using the memory address 
-) *pointer_to_a = 1 vs pointer_to_a = 1
& means you are refering to the memory adress where a remains
unclear the difference between using & and nothing.

Structures definition as pointers:
If you define a previously typedef struct
person *newperson;
That wouldn't work because the pointer doesn't know the size it must have. You need to provide that info by allocating memory
person * myperson = malloc(sizeof(person));
